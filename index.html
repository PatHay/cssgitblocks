                            Git is a version control system; you can think of it as
                            a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base.  With
                            the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole
                            application, seeing the growth of a full app.  During this
                            time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a
                            previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into
                            the your app.

                            GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and
                             collaboration.  It lets you and others work together on projects
                             from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during 
                             development.

                                <span style="color:#4fcdbf">Git add</span> is how we stage the integration of our code base
                                into our current list of snapshots

                                <span style="color:#4fcdbf">Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository
                                where we can place all of our current code.  This is where the outside world can
                                see our code base.

                                at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code
                                and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add
